# LAMPrimers-IQ

A new program is called LAMPrimers iQ and it intended for primers selection for loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The program is developed using Python 3.10, Biopython library and Qt framework. LAMPrimers iQ allows to process long nucleotide sequences and excludes possible homo- and heterodimers of the primers, as well as allows to set stringent selection parameters. These features provide higher amplification specificity and reliable detection of pathogenic RNA.
